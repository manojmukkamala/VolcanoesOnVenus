Welcome to my Project __Volcanoes On Venus__.

```{r, fig.align='center'}

- In this project, I have analyzed the images of Volcanoes on Venus captured by NASA's Magellan spacecraft in 1990.
\

- __[Data Preparation](VenusDataCleansing.html)__ page explains the analysis and data cleansing I carried out on the input data.
\

- __[Git Hub](https://github.com/manojmukkamala/VolcanoesOnVenus)__ page has the code and other documents used for analysis.

#### Background 

- The primary objectives of the Magellan mission were to map the surface of Venus with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and to determine the topographic relief of the planet. 
\

- At the completion of radar mapping 98% of the surface was imaged at resolutions better than 100 m, and many areas were imaged multiple times. 
\

- In the analysis of the data captured by the spacecraft they found volcanoes on the surface on Venus, volcanoes that can be used to make a automatic machine that can detect them.

#### Report

The goal of this project is to experiment with and study the different types of neural network architechtures, from simple hand coded models to complex CNN's using Tensorflow/Keras, in the process of identifying Volcanoes from a given surface image of Venus.

Here are some fun facts about Venus:

- Venus does not have any Moons and so is single.

- Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days while the rotation period is 243 Earth days. So, you are year old even before you are one day old on Venus.


__Models__

I borrowed a lot of ideas from the __[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)__ I completed recently and I implemented the following architectures:

- Logistic Regression

- Shallow Neural Network

- Deep Neural Network

- Convolution Neural Network


In this project, I started with implementing a simple hand crafted logistic regression model using Numpy. Later I implemented more sophisticated models using SKLearn and Keras/Tensorflow.

- The Logistic Regression models and their results can be found here: __[Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/manojmukkamala/VolcanoesOnVenus/blob/master/LogisticModel.ipynb)__


- The Neural Net models along with CNN's and their results can be found here: __[Neural Network Model](https://github.com/manojmukkamala/VolcanoesOnVenus/blob/master/NeuralNetModel.ipynb)__

#### Dataset 

The dataset is obtained at __[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fmena14/volcanoesvenus)__
